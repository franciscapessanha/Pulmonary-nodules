# Segmentation and Texture Analysis of Pulmonary Nodules
Development of an algorithm that allows the segmentation of nodules and the characterization of their texture in non-solid, sub-solid and solid. 

A pipeline for two-dimensional and three-dimensional computed tomography images was design and both tradicional approachs (feature extraction and SVM/kNN training) and Convolutional Neural Networks were implemented.
